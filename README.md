debos
=====

Debian OS builder. debos is a tool to make creation of various debian based os
"images" simpler. While most other tools focus on specific use-case, debos is
more meant as a toolchain to make comon actions trivial while providing enough
rope to do whatever tweaking that might be required behind the scene.
